My Name is Robin Hester and I am a Data Science student at Lambda School. 

I am a huge geek, and I am passionate about what I love. 

You will see most of my projects are popculture related, and that's because I feel popculture speaks a lot about the world.

Stay tuned for interesting and complex ideas in my future projects. 

### My History

Most of my work history is in management in a multitude of fields, mostly retail related. 

My favorite was managing a video game store and the amount of knowledge gamers have about not just games, but comics, and 
manga, and pretty much everything my nerdy heart desired.
